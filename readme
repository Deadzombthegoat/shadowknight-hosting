- **Automated Updates**: Built-in update system that checks for new code from a designated folder and replaces the old code with the new one.
- **Billing System**: Integrated billing system with flexible payment options and easy management of financial aspects.
- **Chat System**: Allows users to communicate and ask for help, fostering a community around the hosting service.
- **Self-Hosting**: Can host itself on any domain, with a default deployment on a VPS or any other server environment.

./start.sh
```

To stop the server, use the `stop.sh` script:

```bash
./stop.sh
```

### Deploying on a Domain

To deploy the platform on your domain, use the `deploy.sh` script:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

To deploy the platform on a specific domain, ensure that the domain is correctly pointed to your VPS or server's IP address. You can then configure the platform to use this domain through the admin panel.

## Security

- **Sensitive Information**: Replace default credentials and secrets (like the `jwtSecret`) with strong, secure values before deploying the platform.
- **HTTPS**: Consider setting up SSL certificates for your domain to secure user data and communications.
